# Data Structures

I have no idea why or how I allowed these damn
things to become such a damn mess. I think instead 
of this abomynation I should just create one data 
structure that does everything I need it to. A collection
like they have in Laravel. The only other structures I 
can see even needing are maybe a list/index and a 
fixed array that extends the PHP one.
